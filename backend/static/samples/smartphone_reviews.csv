"Galaxy S23 Ultra","S12345","CameraLover","R6002","Camera is amazing but battery disappoints","The camera system on this phone is revolutionary - the 200MP main sensor and 10x optical zoom capture incredible detail. However, battery life is not as advertised. I'm barely making it through the day with moderate use. Also, the phone runs hot when using demanding apps.",3,"2023-03-15",TRUE,56
"Galaxy S23 Ultra","S12345","BusinessUser","R6003","Perfect productivity tool","As someone who uses their phone primarily for business, this device is perfect. The large screen makes document editing feasible, the S Pen is great for signing documents and taking notes, and the battery lasts through long workdays. The secure folder feature keeps work and personal content separate.",5,"2023-03-18",TRUE,42
"Galaxy S23 Ultra","S12345","CasualUser","R6004","Too expensive for average users","While this is undoubtedly a premium phone with great features, it's overkill for average users.

"iPhone 14 Pro","S23456","DisappointedUpgrader","R7003","Not worth upgrading from 13 Pro","If you have an iPhone 13 Pro, save your money. The differences are minimal in day-to-day use. The Dynamic Island is more of a gimmick than useful feature, and the always-on display just drains battery faster. Camera improvements are marginal at best. Wait for the next generation.",2,"2023-04-12",TRUE,67

The alert slider is back, OxygenOS feels snappy, and battery life is excellent. The partnership with Hasselblad has improved color science in the camera.",5,"2023-06-05",TRUE,43
"OnePlus 11","S45678","CameraFocused","R9003","Great phone, average camera","Everything about this phone is excellent except the camera, which is just average.

Beyond aesthetics, the phone performs well with a clean, minimal software experience and good battery life.",4,"2023-07-05",TRUE,48
"Nothing Phone 2","S56789","MinimalistUser","R10002","Refreshingly different","In a sea of similar-looking smartphones, this device stands out. The software is clean without bloatware, the Glyph interface is subtle but useful, and performance is smooth for everyday tasks. Camera is decent but not exceptional. Battery easily lasts a full day.",4,"2023-07-08",TRUE,36
"Nothing Phone 2","S56789","EarlyAdopter","R10003","Promising but unrefined","The concept and design are innovative, but the execution needs refinement. I've experienced software bugs, and the camera processing is inconsistent. When everything works, it's a great experience, but the reliability isn't there yet. Feels like a product still in development.",3,"2023-07-12",TRUE,42
"Nothing Phone 2","S56789","DisappointedBuyer2","R10004","Style over substance","While the phone looks unique, the novelty wears off quickly.

Not recommended at this price point.",2,"2023-07-15",TRUE,39
"Nothing Phone 2","S56789","TechEnthusiast2","R10005","Breath of fresh air","This phone brings something new to a stagnant market. The hardware is solid with good performance and battery life.
